  as well as various reports and statistics.

## What is Jenkins?

* Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration.

* Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place.

* Along with Jenkins, sometimes, one might also see the association of Hudson.

* Hudson is a very popular open-source Java-based continuous integration tool developed by Sun Microsystems which was later acquired by Oracle.

* After the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, a fork was created from the Hudson source code, which brought about the introduction of Jenkins.

## What is Continuous Integration?

* Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. 

* This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle.
